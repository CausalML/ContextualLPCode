# ContextualLPCode
Replication code for the paper [Fast Rates for Contextual Linear Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03030).

Figure 2(b) can be generated by first running "experiment.py" to obtain the csv files "regret_no_kernel.csv", "regret_kernel_SGD.csv", "regret_kernel_gurobi.csv", and then running "plotting.R".
